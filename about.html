          <h1>About Us</h1>

          <h2><span>Healer, Yoga Instructor & Spiritual Teacher</span></h2>

          <p> I have been a healer by profession for 5 years and have studied
            Energy healing, Reki and Soul Realignment. This type of healing
            methods have helped hundreds of my clients to get rid of physical
            pain and energetic blocks that have hindered them to fully live
            their life. I also work as a Yoga instructor at a local facility i
            Malm√∂, Sweden. I teach people how to meditate and do diffrent yoga
            positions.</p>

            <p> professional training as a healer began in a remote
            community up in the mountains called Idyllwild. I was blessed to be
            taught for 5 years in a full immersion training: averaging 12 hours
            a day, 6 days a week. After the first 6 months of just working on
            myself, the rest of my training was done while I worked with
            clients, with my teacher closely monitoring my work. It was as
            rewarding as it was challenging. I believe we all have several gifts
            we came into this life with. But just like the person who has a gift
            to be a great musician, without training and practice they will
            never manifest that gift to its full potential. </p>
            
            <p> One of my gifts as energy healer came in with its gift to heal, but this latent talent did not
            begin to be clearly evident until I committed to the disciplined and
            comprehensive training and practice that I was extremely fortunate
            to receive.</p>
            
            <p> I have worked with and helped Shamans, Kahunas and
            various amazing healers who have spent their lives on spiritual
            journeys, as well as those that are just discovering there is more
            to this life. I have a personal understanding of what it takes to
            heal the physical limitations of being a highly sensitive person and
            use this gift in profound ways.</p> 
            
            <p> I am also a highly sensitive person. As a child I didn't know what to do with it. 
            I learned to be in fear. I lived most of my life in fear of what others thought of me.
            Fear of making a mistake. Fear of being rejected. Fear of not being
            loved.</p>
